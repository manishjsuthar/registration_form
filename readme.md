          Assuming that the requirement for the admission form is clear, here are the possible steps for implementing it using React as the frontend language and any backend language for the REST API:

         1. Create a React application using the create-react-app command. This will scaffold a new React application with the necessary dependencies and configuration.
          
         2. Create a form component in the React application that will accept the user's details such as name, age, and preferred batch. The form should include fields for the user to enter their name, age, and batch preference, as well as a submit button.
          
         3.  Add basic validations to the form fields to ensure that the user's age is within the required range (18-65), and that they have selected a valid batch. If the user's input is invalid, the form should display an error message indicating what is wrong with the input.
          
         4. When the user submits the form, the React application should make a call to the REST API using the user's details as the payload. The REST API should accept the user's data and perform the necessary validations, such as checking the user's age and ensuring that they have selected a valid batch.
          
         5. If the user's input is valid, the REST API should call the CompletePayment() function to process the payment for the monthly classes. The CompletePayment() function should return a response indicating whether the payment was successful or not.
          
         6. The REST API should then return the payment response to the React application, which should display a message to the user indicating the result of the payment.
          
         7. In case the payment was successful, the user should be able to enroll in the monthly classes and choose their preferred batch. They should also be able to pay the monthly fees at any time during the month.
          
         8. With these steps, we can implement a simple admission form for the Yoga Classes that meets the requirements specified in the prompt.



To implement this admission form, I would use React to create the frontend, and I would choose a backend language like Node.js to create the REST API.

For the database, I would design an Entity Relationship (ER) diagram with the following entities:

User: This entity would store the details of the users who enroll in the yoga classes, such as their name, age, and the batch they have chosen.
Payment: This entity would store the details of the payments made by the users, such as the amount paid and the date of payment.
The ER diagram for the database design would look something like this:

                                       +---------------+
                                       |     User      |
                                       +---------------+
                                       | id            |
                                       | name          |
                                       | age           |
                                       |payment_type   |
                                       |mobile         |
                                       | batch         |
                                       +---------------+
                                                |
                                                |
                                       +---------------+
                                       |    Payment     |
                                       +---------------+
                                       | id            |
                                       | user_id       |
                                       | amount        |
                                       | payment_date  |
                                       +---------------+
The user data would be stored in the User table, and the payment data would be stored in the Payment table. The user_id attribute in the Payment table would be a foreign key that references the id attribute in the User table. This would allow us to track the payments made by each user.

When the user submits the form, the frontend would make a call to the REST API with the user's details. The API would then perform basic validations on the data, such as checking that the user's age is within the specified range (18-65), and that the user has selected a valid batch. If the data is valid, the API
